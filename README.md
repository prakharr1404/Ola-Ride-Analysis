Ola Ride Data Analysis using PowerBi

This project aims to analyze OLA ride data using SQL for data extraction and RapidMiner for machine learning-driven insights. The objective is to enhance driver performance monitoring and optimize Estimated Time of Arrival (ETA) predictions, improving customer experience and operational efficiency. We first utilize SQL queries to extract key insights, including successful bookings, ride cancellations, payment methods, and customer ratings. This structured data serves as input for advanced analytics in RapidMiner. For driver performance analysis, we implement Anomaly Detection using the Isolation Forest algorithm to identify drivers with excessive cancellations or poor ratings, enabling targeted interventions. Additionally, Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models are used to predict ETA and ride duration, incorporating factors such as historical ride data, traffic conditions, and time of day. The insights generated are visualized in Power BI dashboards, providing actionable intelligence for business decisions. By integrating SQL for data retrieval and RapidMiner for machine learning, this project delivers an automated, scalable, and data-driven solution for improving ride efficiency and customer satisfaction.
